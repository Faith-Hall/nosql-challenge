#### The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
---
## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
1. Import establishments.json file from Terminal, name database `uk_food`, and name collection `establishments`.
2. Import libararies needed: PyMongo and pprint
3. Create an instance of the Mongo Client
4. Confirm database was created and data was loaded properly
5. Assign the `establishments` collection to a variable to prepare the collection for use. 

## Part 2: Updated the Database
1. Add the following resturant to the database
```
{
    "BusinessName":"Penang Flavours",
    "BusinessType":"Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen",
    "BusinessTypeID":"",
    "AddressLine1":"Penang Flavours",
    "AddressLine2":"146A Plumstead Rd",
    "AddressLine3":"London",
    "AddressLine4":"",
    "PostCode":"SE18 7DY",
    "Phone":"",
    "LocalAuthorityCode":"511",
    "LocalAuthorityName":"Greenwich",
    "LocalAuthorityWebSite":"http://www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk",
    "LocalAuthorityEmailAddress":"health@royalgreenwich.gov.uk",
    "scores":{
        "Hygiene":"",
        "Structural":"",
        "ConfidenceInManagement":""
    },
    "SchemeType":"FHRS",
    "geocode":{
        "longitude":"0.08384000",
        "latitude":"51.49014200"
    },
    "RightToReply":"",
    "Distance":4623.9723280747176,
    "NewRatingPending":True
}
```
2. Find the BusinessTypeID for "Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen" and return only the `BusinessTypeID` and `BusinessType` fields.
3. Update the new restaurant with the `BusinessTypeID` you found.
4. The magazine is not interested in any establishments in Dover, so check how many documents contain the Dover Local Authority. Then, remove any establishments within the Dover Local Authority from the database, and check the number of documents to ensure they were deleted.
5. Some of the number values are stored as strings, when they should be stored as numbers.
  - Use `update_many` to convert `latitude` and `longitude` to decimal numbers.
  - Use `update_many` to convert `RatingValue` to integer numbers.
## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
